 @brief Application to run on a mesh router. The application sets up a custom
 CoAP resource called "data" that responds to incoming requests. Also, if it 
 receives a PUT with an IPv6 address, it starts sending CoAP NoAck messages to that
 address periodically (every 10 seconds) as well. To aid debugging, it prints out
 the source and destination address on UART as well
