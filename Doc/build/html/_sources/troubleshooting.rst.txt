Troubleshooting
===============

I'm not able to access the serial port
--------------------------------------
Your user must be part of the **dialout** group. Use this command to fix it

.. code-block:: bash

    sudo adduser $USER dialout

You need to re-login (or even reboot) for the changes to take effect


How do I find the IP address of the Edge Computer
-------------------------------------------------
Execute the following command

.. code-block:: bash

    ip a

This will list all addresses associated with your system. For example:

.. code-block:: bash
    :emphasize-lines: 3,5

    2: eth0: <BROADCAST,MULTICAST,UP,LOWER_UP> mtu 1500 qdisc pfifo_fast state UP group default qlen 1000
        link/ether XX:XX:XX:XX:XX:XX brd ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff
        inet XXX.XXX.XXX.XXX/24
        valid_lft 2653sec preferred_lft 2024sec
        inet6 XXXX::XXXX:XXXX:XXXX:XXXX/64
        valid_lft forever preferred_lft forever


For accessing Node RED, you can use either the IPv4 (specified by **inet** above) or IPv6 address (specified by **inet6** above) of the board.


How do I find the serial port used for the Border Router
--------------------------------------------------------

In Linux, the drivers for the USB-to-UART IC (FTDI FT-series) is built into the kernel. When a new board is connected, a new device will automatically appear in the **/dev/** folder. The name will be ttyUSB followed by a number, which start at zero for the first device enumerated. Therefore:

- The first device enumerated will get the device **/dev/ttyUSB0**
- The next will get the device **/dev/ttyUSB1**
- ....and so on.
